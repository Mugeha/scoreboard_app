This is a simple LAMP stack web application designed for a competition scoring system.  
- Admins can add judges via an Admin Panel.  
- Judges can assign scores to participants through a Judge Portal.  
- A public scoreboard displays participants ranked by their total points with dynamic highlighting and auto-refresh.

- **Apache** (HTTP server)  
- **MySQL** (Database)  
- **PHP** (Server-side scripting)  
- **Bootstrap 5** (Frontend CSS framework)

## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/scoreboard_app.git
cd scoreboard_app
```
---

## Create the database and tables

```bash
CREATE DATABASE scoreboard_app;
USE scoreboard_app;

CREATE TABLE judges (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    display_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE participants (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE scores (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    judge_id INT NOT NULL,
    participant_id INT NOT NULL,
    score INT NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (judge_id) REFERENCES judges(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (participant_id) REFERENCES participants(id)
);

```

---

## Configure database connection

- Create a .env file in the project root with:

```bash

DB_HOST=your-host
DB_USER=your-username
DB_PASS=your-password
DB_NAME=your-db-name
```
- Update db.php to read from .env and connect to the database securely

---

## Set up your Apache server

- Ensure PHP and MySQL are installed and running.
- Place the project files in your web root (/var/www/html/scoreboard_app or similar)

---

## Assumptions

- User authentication is out of scope for this demo.

- Judges and participants are manually added via Admin Panel and direct DB inserts respectively.

- Scores range from 1 to 100 points.

- The application runs on a local or internal server; no HTTPS enforcement implemented.

---

## Design choices

- Used prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.

- Bootstrap 5 for clean and responsive UI without heavy frontend frameworks.

- Scores table stores individual judge-participant scores to allow flexible aggregation.

- Auto-refresh for scoreboard implemented via HTML meta tag for simplicity.

---

## Future improvements

- Add user authentication and role-based access control.

- Enhance UI with AJAX for real-time score submission and dynamic scoreboard updates without full page reload.

- Add participant registration flow.

- Deploy on cloud hosting with HTTPS.

- Improve error handling and logging.
